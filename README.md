Hello,

Please read the below given instructions carefully and kindly submit by Friday EOD.
As an associate DevOps engineer, your task is to set up a Minikube Kubernetes cluster on your local machine or EKS on AWS and deploy the EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack on it. The EFK stack will be used to collect, process, and visualize logs from the Minikube cluster.

Configure Fluentd to Collect Minikube Logs:

Modify the Fluentd configuration to collect logs from the Minikube components (API server, Scheduler, etc.).
Ensure Fluentd forwards these logs to Elasticsearch.

Visualize Logs in Kibana:

Access the Kibana UI and configure an index pattern to start visualizing the logs collected by Fluentd.
Create visualizations and dashboards in Kibana to monitor the Minikube logs.

Submit Logs and Visualizations:

Take screenshots of the Kibana dashboards and visualizations showing Minikube logs.
Also send a Readme specifying the steps/commands used to deploy EFK along with configurations
